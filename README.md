# flexbox-fun
a series of experiments I did a while back with Flexbox based on the Skeleton CSS Framework: http://getskeleton.com/

This is bare metal css and html so take what you need and leave the rest. 

What's included:

- 2 col flex layout
- flex layout with nav & content
- image grid with flex (not a huge fan of using flex for image grids but whatevs)
- a bootstrap inspired responsive nav with flex
- an icon based nav with font awesome icons
