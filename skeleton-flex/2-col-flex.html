          <h2>The Lone Wolf</h2>
          <p>We artists are a different breed of people. We're a happy bunch. When you do it your way you can go anywhere you choose. Go out on a limb - that's where the fruit is. Just make little strokes like that. This is where you take out all your hostilities and frustrations. It's better than kicking the puppy dog around and all that so. It's life. It's interesting. It's fun.</p>
          <p>Just think about these things in your mind and drop em' on canvas. Nothing wrong with washing your brush. Happy painting, God bless. Decide where your cloud lives. Maybe he lives right in here.</p>
          <p>Let's put a touch more of the magic here. Absolutely no pressure. You are just a whisper floating across a mountain. Isn't it fantastic that you can change your mind and create all these happy things? Just think about these things in your mind - then bring them into your world. Any little thing can be your friend if you let it be.</p>
